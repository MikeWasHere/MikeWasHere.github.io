						<h2>Kayla Parker</h2>
						<h3>Personal Trainer</h3>
						<p>Fitness to me means having a healthy mind, body and spirit to allow you to maximize your potential. When your body is healthy, the mind and spirit usually follow suit. Fitness isn&#39;t about numbers on a scale, it&#39;s about feeling good inside and out.</p>
						<p>I&#39;m the baby of 5 and come from an extremely competitive family. I was a gymnast, played softball and volleyball and ran track. I ran track at University of South Carolina before I had a career ending injury my sophomore year. I was no longer able to run and found myself in a deep depression. Being hurt, I was in the training room 4 hours a day. My day was school and rehab, no track. No team. I was needing to find a way to clear my mind, to deal with the pain of no longer having sports in my life, and to get out of my depression. I found the weight room, found a new way to work out, and realized how much I loved it! Eventually it became my sanctuary.</p>
						<p>My favorite exercises are squats, lunges and anything with resistance bands. Oh and the stairclimber is a girls best friend.</p>
						<p>I bring a super athletic background to fithaus. I&#39;ve played multiple sports at collegiate and elite levels. I pay close attention to detail and have a crazy work ethic.</p>

						<h2>Yasmine Savage</h2>
						<h3>Personal Trainer</h3>
						<p>Fitness is a lifestyle for me. Not just your physical appearance but your Mind body and soul. I would have to say my favorite exercise is anything to do with the booty. I mean who doesn&#39;t want a nice bum. Resistance bands are my favorite. Really isolates the glutes. Always chasing the booty pump. What I bring to fithaus  is a great sense of energy and my goal to is to inspire my clients with positivity.</p>
